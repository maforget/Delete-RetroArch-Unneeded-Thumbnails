# Delete Unneeded Retroarch Thumbnails
Utility that will read playlists and compare thumbnails in a RetroArch installation. It will output the missing thumbnails based on the playlists entries and delete unneeded (extra) thumbnails that aren't associated with a playlists entry. It also checks each playlists, determines the roms path and compare the folder with the associated playlist and output the files that aren't part of the playlists. Most probably they where not detected when scanning the folder. The apps works for the new type of playlists (v1.7.6 and later) and understands relative and absolute paths.

Usage or drag the retroarch folder on top of the exe
```
Delete.Unneeded.RetroArch.Thumnails.exe <pathToRetroARch>
```
you can also copy the files inside the retroarch folder, and open it from there, without passing any path.
